FINCHFS is an ad hoc parallel file system for HPC based on the design of `CHFS <https://github.com/otatebe/chfs>`_.

FINCHFS is a user-level parallel ad hoc file system, so it has the following features:

* It is easy to install and use. It does not require root privileges.
* FINCHFS can only be accessed from the FINCHFS client library.
* When the HPC job ends, the server shuts down and the saved data is lost.

FINCHFS also has the following features:

* It is not a POSIX-compliant file system. It does not support file locking, file truncate, etc.
* FINCHFS has two backends, pmemkv backend and POSIX backend.
* FINCHFS use node-local storage. For pmemkv backend, FINCHFS uses Intel Optane Persistent Memory via pmemkv. For POSIX backend, FINCHFS uses NVMe SSD via POSIX API.
